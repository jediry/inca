Open design questions:

I) Rendering subsystem:
  ~) Should hardware capabilities be represented by enumeration constants?
     Or ought there be specific get* functions for each?
     Or both?
  ~) How should rendering modes be controlled?
        * tag classes? (e.g., Wireframe, Solid, Selection)
            classes could contain sets of state variables
                Wireframe = no lights, line antialiasing
            could have an open set of modes, including semantic modes
                "Selected", "Pointed To"
                "Ghosting", "Wireframe", "Solid"
                "Bounding box"
                Modes for implicit surfaces:
                    "sampled points"/splats
                    "isoparameters"
        * how to do fog, lighting, etc.
  ~) Make renderer throw exceptions for unsupported features

II) Raster system
    Make gradient operator more general-purpose (different kinds of derivatives)
        e.g., fwd-diff, symm-diff, LxLxx Lxy yada yada
    More general marching-cubes/isosurface mechanism
        better optimized
