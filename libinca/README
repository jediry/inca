Physically Based Modeling, Fall 2003

Homework 5: Rigid bodies

Running the programs:
    For this assignment, as I haven't gotten around to implement any sort of
    parameter file loading, there are several executables. They all have the
    same controls:
    You can reposition the view using the mouse:
        Ctrl + Alt + Left mouse -- zoom in/out
        Alt + Middle mouse      -- pan
        Alt + Right mouse       -- spin
    Press Escape to quit, and space ' ' to start/pause the simulation


Status:
    I got RK4 integration working for this project (yay!).
    I can now load OBJ files to create the geometry for my model.
    Moment of inertia is calculated using just the vertices of the model,
        rather than an actual integration.
    I haven't gotten to collisions yet.

The guided tour:
    The physical dynamics stuff is in src/dynamics/ and its 'rigid-body' subdir.
    The interesting files are:
        DynamicSystem -- generic physically based system (particle, rigid body)
        ODESolvers    -- Euler, RK2, and RK4 explicit integrators
        StateVector   -- exactly what it sounds like
        rigid-body/RigidBody -- RB specialization of the generic PBM stuff
        ConstantOperators -- simple operators that apply a constant force/torque
        GravityOperators -- gravity
        SpringOperators -- RB version of a damped spring

    You may also want to look at GLUTWorldView.c++ (in src/), as this contains
    most of the setup code.
